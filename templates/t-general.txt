	We all have that certain place at home where we keep all of our random stuff.  You know, that place you throw stuff in when you're not quite 
	sure where to put it but you know that you want to save it for when you might need it.  The problem is though that when you finally do need it 
	you just can't seem to find it.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">
	Did you ever want to show someone a picture and it took forever to find it because you had to look through 
	the thousands of photos on your phone?  Did you ever want to remake a recipe you tried but forgot where you put it or which site you found it 
	on?  All these problems and much more can be solved with My Drawer.  Now there's one place to store all your loose random things and you'll 
	be able to search and find them in the blink of an eye. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
	My Drawer is the perfect place to keep all those things you want to save but aren’t quite sure where to save them.  It'll be extremely easy 
	to find your stuff in this drawer because you'll be able to put your things in trays that you create within your drawer in order to keep it more 
	organized.  With this organized drawer you'll no longer waste time searching for things because they'll all be stored neatly and organized in 
	your very own drawer. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">
	With My Drawer you can basically store anything that you want including but not limited to pictures, articles and videos from the web and 
	be able to search for any of it and find it instantly.  Use your imagination!
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
	If your parents, kids or friends ask for something, you can allow them to look in your drawer.  They can also share their things with you as well.
